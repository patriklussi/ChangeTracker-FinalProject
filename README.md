# ChangeTracker- Final Project for Lexicons C# .Net course

This is the backend for my final project for Lexicon Malm√∂s .NET C# system developer course.

It uses ASP.NET Core Web API, Entity Framework and SQL server as a database.

# The project - ChangeTracker
ChangeTracker is a web application that helps users keep track of a selected 90 day challenge. This could be anything from learning to code to deadlifting 200kg.
It is meant to help keep track of and motivate its users to not give up on the chosen challenge.
